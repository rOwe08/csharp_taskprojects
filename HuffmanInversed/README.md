The goal is to write a program, which will receive a name of the compressed file (with the extension ".huff"). The assignment is to read the Huffman Tree from this file and based on this tree perform a decompression of the data that follows the tree. Decompressed data should be stored into the output file, with the same name as the input file, but without the ".huff" extension. If the program does not receive exactly one argument, or if the argument isn't valid (has incorrect extension), the output should be a string "Argument Error" to the std. output. If input or output file can't be opened, or read (resp. written), or the input file doesn't have to correct format, output should be a string "File Error".
